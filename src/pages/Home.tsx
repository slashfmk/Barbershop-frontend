                        We offer children haircuts for all kids ten years of age and younger.
                        If you’re wondering if your child’s temper will permit a haircut, you can rest easy. Our specialists know how to work with kids. Some kids tolerate haircuts just fine and will sit still, even as the clippers start buzzing. Other kids get upset at the sight of the scissors and the sensation of the hair-styling clippers. You can rest assured that we are experts at providing your child with the best haircut while tending to his or her every need and ensuring a memorable haircut experience.
